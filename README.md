# PIMM Python Rewrite

This project is a Python implementation of the PIMM (Pi-system Molecular Mechanics) program, originally written in Fortran 77. 
It performs molecular mechanics calculations based on a given input file.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you must have the following installed on your system:

* **Python 3:** This script is written for Python 3. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* **NumPy:** A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone or Download the Project:**
    Ensure you have all the project files, including `pimm_python_rewrite.py`, in a single directory.

2.  **Install NumPy:**
    This project requires the NumPy library. Open your terminal or command prompt and install it using pip:
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    py -m pip install numpy

    # On macOS or Linux
    python3 -m pip install numpy
    ```
    If you are using an IDE like PyCharm, it is highly recommended to install the package through the IDE's built-in package manager to ensure it is added to the correct project interpreter.

## How to Run the Program

To execute the script, you must provide an input file (e.g., `Pentanes.ein`) as a command-line argument.

1.  **Open a Terminal:**
    Navigate to the project's root directory where `pimm_python_rewrite.py` is located.

2.  **Execute the Script:**
    Run the following command:
    ```bash
    python pimm_python_rewrite.py Pentanes.ein
    ```
    *Note: On Windows, you may need to use `py` instead of `python`.*

The program will then run the calculations based on the parameters in `Pentanes.ein` and produce its output.

## Troubleshooting

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'`

This is the most common error and occurs if NumPy is not installed in the Python environment you are using to run the script.

* **Solution:** Follow the installation steps above.
* **IDE Users (PyCharm, VS Code):** Ensure that you have selected the correct Python interpreter for your projectâ€”one that has NumPy installed. Use the IDE's integrated terminal to run the script, as it will automatically use the correct environment.

### `Command 'python' not found` or `'python' is not recognized...`

This error means the Python executable is not in your system's PATH environment variable.

* **Solution for Windows:** Use the `py` launcher, which should be available by default:
    ```bash
    py pimm_python_rewrite.py Pentanes.ein
    ```
* **General Solution:** Reinstall Python and make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** during the installation process.
