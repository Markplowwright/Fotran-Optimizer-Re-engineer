# PIMM Python Rewrite

This project is a Python implementation of the PIMM (Pi-system Molecular Mechanics) program, originally written in Fortran. It is a computational chemistry tool used to predict the three-dimensional structure and conformational energy of molecules.

## Core Concepts

The program's methodology combines classical **molecular mechanics (MM)** with a quantum mechanical treatment for conjugated **pi-electron systems**. This hybrid approach makes it particularly powerful for analyzing molecules like aromatic compounds, polyenes, and dyes, where electron delocalization significantly influences molecular shape and stability.

### How It Works

1.  **Force Field:** The classical mechanics component relies on a **force field**, which is a collection of equations and parameters that define the potential energy of a molecule based on its geometry. The energy is calculated as a sum of terms:
    * **Bond Stretching:** The energy required to stretch or compress a bond from its equilibrium length.
    * **Angle Bending:** The energy required to bend an angle between three atoms.
    * **Torsional Strain:** The energy associated with rotating a group of atoms around a central bond.
    * **Non-Bonded Interactions:** Van der Waals forces (short-range repulsion and long-range attraction) and electrostatic interactions between atoms that are not directly bonded.

2.  **Pi-System Calculation (SCF):** The defining feature of PIMM is its specialized handling of conjugated pi-systems. Instead of using purely classical terms, it employs a quantum mechanical **Self-Consistent Field (SCF)** method (like the Pariser-Parr-Pople method) to calculate the electronic structure of the pi-system. This allows for a more accurate description of bond orders and electronic properties, which are then used to modify the classical force field terms.

3.  **Geometry Optimization:** The primary goal is to find the molecule's most stable structure, known as the **global energy minimum**. The program achieves this through geometry optimization. Starting from an initial guess of the molecular structure (provided in the input file), it iteratively adjusts the coordinates of each atom to lower the total potential energy. This process continues until the forces on the atoms are close to zero, indicating that an energy minimum has been reached.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you must have the following installed on your system:

* **Python 3:** This script is written for Python 3. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* **NumPy:** A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone or Download the Project:**
    Ensure you have all the project files, including `pimm_python_rewrite.py`, in a single directory.

2.  **Install NumPy:**
    This project requires the NumPy library. Open your terminal or command prompt and install it using pip:
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    py -m pip install numpy

    # On macOS or Linux
    python3 -m pip install numpy
    ```
    If you are using an IDE like PyCharm, it is highly recommended to install the package through the IDE's built-in package manager to ensure it is added to the correct project interpreter.

## How to Run the Program

To execute the script, you must provide an input file (e.g., `Pentanes.ein`) as a command-line argument. This file contains the initial molecular geometry, atom types, and connectivity.

1.  **Open a Terminal:**
    Navigate to the project's root directory where `pimm_python_rewrite.py` is located.

2.  **Execute the Script:**
    Run the following command:
    ```bash
    python pimm_python_rewrite.py Pentanes.ein
    ```
    *Note: On Windows, you may need to use `py` instead of `python`.*

The program will then perform the geometry optimization and output the final, low-energy structure and its associated conformational energy.

## Input File (`.ein`) Format

The `.ein` file provides the starting point for the calculation. It defines the molecule's initial structure and composition. While the exact format can vary, it generally follows this structure:

* **Line 1: Title:** A descriptive title for the molecule or calculation.
* **Line 2: Control Parameters:** Flags or values that control the calculation (e.g., number of atoms, charge).
* **Atom Specification Block:** A list of all atoms in the molecule. Each line describes one atom and typically includes:
    * Atom number (index)
    * Atom type (e.g., 'C', 'H', 'O') or a specific force field atom type (e.g., 'C3' for sp3 carbon).
    * X, Y, and Z coordinates (in Angstroms).
* **Connectivity Block (Optional):** Some formats may include an explicit list of bonds, defining which atoms are connected. In other cases, connectivity is determined automatically from interatomic distances.

### Example `.ein` Structure:


Example Molecule: Ethane
8 Atoms, 0 Charge
1 C  -0.765  0.000  0.000
2 C   0.765  0.000  0.000
3 H  -1.150  1.020  0.000
4 H  -1.150 -0.510  0.880
5 H  -1.150 -0.510 -0.880
6 H   1.150  1.020  0.000
7 H   1.150 -0.510  0.880
8 H   1.150 -0.510 -0.880


## Output Description

After a successful run, the program provides the results of the geometry optimization. The output is typically printed directly to the terminal and may include:

* **Initial Energy:** The calculated potential energy of the starting geometry.
* **Optimization Steps:** A log of the energy at each step of the optimization process.
* **Final Energy:** The final, minimized conformational energy of the molecule (often in kcal/mol).
* **Optimized Coordinates:** A list of the final X, Y, Z coordinates for each atom, representing the low-energy structure. This can be used in molecular visualization software.
* **Generated Output Files:** The program may also generate output files (e.g., `output.eout`, `molecule.xyz`) containing the final coordinates in a standard format for easy viewing and analysis.

## Troubleshooting

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'`

This is the most common error and occurs if NumPy is not installed in the Python environment you are using to run the script.

* **Solution:** Follow the installation steps above.
* **IDE Users (PyCharm, VS Code):** Ensure that you have selected the correct Python interpreter for your projectâ€”one that has NumPy installed. Use the IDE's integrated terminal to run the script, as it will automatically use the correct environment.

### `Command 'python' not found` or `'python' is not recognized...`

This error means the Python executable is not in your system's PATH environment variable.

* **Solution for Windows:** Use the `py` launcher, which should be available by default:
    ```bash
    py pimm_python_rewrite.py Pentanes.ein
    ```
* **General Solution:** Reinstall Python and make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** during the installation process.
